<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Olena Serdyuk but I prefer to be called Helena.<br/>
I was born on June 28, 1995 in a small town in the west of Ukraine. I was a very happy kid, I liked to sing, to draw, to paint,
to write stories. Once I completed middle school, my mom took me with her to Italy, where I completed High School and University.
I have been living in Italy for a lot of years.<br/>

<p>Courently i live in Brooklyn (USA). I moved here in July 2024. I like living here because i am close 
  to my family. In September 2025 I am starting to study in colledge. I applied for an Associate degree in Computer information Systems.
  It's about Information Tecnology applied to the business.
I like this major because im going to study programming and computing, but also economy and business.</p>

<p>I am completing a web development course when i learned how to build a web site and how to host it in internet. This web site is 
  written in HTML, it's very simple, but I am proud of it because it is my first web site.
